## Introduction

As a developer, member of a team, I use Github every day and feel like I don’t have enough visibility on what PR’s I need to review, and personally don’t find Github UI very appealing.

<br>

## Purpose

The purpose for this project is to create a custom Github front-end, using Vue 3 and Typescript, **fully powered by the Github Rest API**, that displays all the information I want to see from Github, grouped and sorted the way I feel would make me more productive in my day-to-day life as a developer.
